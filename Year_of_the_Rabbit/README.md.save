# Year Of The Rabbit

## Recon

Runing an nmap scan against the target.

FTP SSH and http are runing. Visiting the HTTP Site I'm greeted with an apacha default landing page.

### HTTP

runing dirbuster while reading the landing page

	gobuster dir --url http://10.10.98.211 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -o scans/gobuster

found assets with rickrol mp4

Found no exploit for this apache version on Exploit DB. But According to 
https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0226
this exploit couol work:
https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/34133

There are sevaral issus in this version of apache that I want to try and attack

https://www.tenable.com/plugins/was/98910 

I did some reading and found some intresting things I want to try

- CVE-2016-5387

The first thing I want to test is Httpoxy

	git clone https://github.com/1N3/HTTPoxyScan.git

After fiddling around with this script I didn't finde anything. So on to more enumeration. Whole runing dirbuster on the side with a big list and file extentions

- CVE-2016-8743

runing a whole lot of stuff used Metasploit Apache user enumeration tool but did not find anything. 
Runing Nikto

** -> I think I'am overcomplicating this, I can run the rickrol, so I should test if I can upload a file to /assets and run an exploit from there **

I was still makeing everything to complicated (for a CTF at least) In the stylesheet there is a hint

	Nice to see someone checking the stylesheets.
	Take a look at the page: /sup3r_s3cr3t_fl4g.php
  	
-> it's another rickroll XD

The Popup says to disable javascript. In firefox type about:config in the adressbar and set javascript.enable to false

then a new window shows up:


´´´
Love it when people block Javascript...
This is happening whether you like it or not... The hint is in the video. If you're stuck here then you're just going to have to bite the bullet!
Make sure your audio is turned up!
´´´

Continue here do another nmpa scan but use -vv

	nmap --script=vuln -vv -oA scans/second 10.10.228.174
